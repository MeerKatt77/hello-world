My first repository

Hello Everyone!

I am a current computer science student and I need to learn as many skills as possible.  
Using Github to create a project is a good start. I like C# and have experience with Java, Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML.  
I am hoping to collaborate with other people to create some neat projects.
